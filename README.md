# -HexSoftwares_Project_FIBONACCI-GENERATOR
Fibonacci Generator
This Python project generates the Fibonacci sequence using a generator function. The program continuously generates Fibonacci numbers, and the user can control the flow by pressing the Enter key to get the next number.

Features:

Infinite Fibonacci Sequence: 
The program generates Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.

Interactive:
The user presses Enter to reveal the next Fibonacci number.

Generator Function:
Utilizes Pythonâ€™s yield for memory-efficient generation.

How It Works:
The program defines a generator function fib() that yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely.
The while True loop allows the Fibonacci sequence to continue without an end, pausing each time until the user presses Enter.

Prerequisites:
Python 3.x

About:
This project was completed during my internship at HexSoftware, where I had the opportunity to work on Python and learn how to efficiently use generator functions to handle infinite sequences.

Feel free to check out the project, and provide feedback or suggestions!
